# QOSF Mentorship Program Screening Task

Hello! I am Kunal Sinha and this is my entry for the screening task of the Quantum Open Source Foundation Mentorship Program. \n

I chose to do TASK 4 and have successfully completed it. I chose this task mostly because the description read "this exercise might be pretty difficult", and indeed it was challenging but at the same time a great learning experience. VQE is indeed quite interesting. 
Thank you for creating this opportunity!
